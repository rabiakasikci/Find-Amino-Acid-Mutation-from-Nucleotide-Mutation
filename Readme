This code finds the amino acid mutation from the specified nucleotide mutation.
First of all, you should list the nucleotide mutations as follows from Mutation_List file;
A0C
T1G

Do_Point_Mutation.py = Do the spesific mutation by using the Ref_Nuc.txt (Referance nucleotit sequence)
 
Dna2Pro.py Convert DNA to RNA
Merged2File.py This code use for preparing file for clustalomega.
Compare2Sequnces.py= After alignment, all sequences compare each others.


***ALSO, you must have CLUSTALOMEGA program for alignment.

USAGE:

After fill the Ref_Protein , Ref_Nuc and Mutation_List.txt

chmod +x FindMut.sh
./FindMut.sh
